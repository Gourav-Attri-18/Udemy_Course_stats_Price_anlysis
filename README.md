# Udemy Course Stats & Price Analysis

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of **Udemy course data** using Python's powerful libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and data visualization tools like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. The analysis aims to uncover insights into pricing patterns, subject popularity, and user engagement across various courses on Udemy.

Key aspects explored in this analysis:
- **Course Pricing Patterns**: Analyzed how courses are priced across different categories and regions.
- **Subject Popularity**: Explored the popularity of courses in different subjects and how it impacts course pricing.
- **User Engagement**: Investigated the relationship between course ratings, reviews, and user engagement.
- **Trends and Visualizations**: Used data visualization techniques to visualize key trends and provide actionable business insights.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For conducting the analysis and documenting the process.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains detailed information about Udemy courses, including:
- Course Title
- Category
- Price
- Ratings
- Number of Reviews
- Course Duration
- Instructor Information

## Key Insights
- Pricing trends across different categories.
- The correlation between course ratings and pricing.
- Popular subjects with the highest engagement.
- Recommendations for course creators based on user behavior and pricing trends.

## Project Structure
- `udemy_course_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used in the project (ensure you don't share sensitive data publicly).
- `images/`: Folder containing graphs and visualizations generated during the analysis.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the `udemy_course_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to see the analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Enhancements
- Perform sentiment analysis on course reviews to better understand user opinions.
- Use machine learning models to predict course pricing based on various factors.
- Incorporate more datasets (e.g., course completion rates, instructor experience).
